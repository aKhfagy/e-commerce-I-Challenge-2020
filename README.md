# e-commerce-I-Challenge-2020

This project was done as the final project in the IChallenge Android Track at [Clicks Egypt](https://www.clicksegypt.net/).

It is a shoping application for McDonald's, the menu was taken from this [website](https://food.ndtv.com/restaurants/mcdonalds-mcd-prices-and-menu-1790160). It was an increadible experience working with this team and the instructor was [Eng. Amr Abdelhameed](https://github.com/AmrAbdelhameed) who was increadibly eager to help us and share his knowledge.

The team consisted of [Pierre Ehab (me)](https://github.com/PierreEhab), [Ahmed Khfagy](https://github.com/aKhfagy), and [Sara Nimer](https://github.com/Sara-M8).

  - Forget password
